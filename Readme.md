## 📖 Overview

kacchiOS is a simple, bare-metal operating system built from scratch for educational purposes. It provides a clean foundation for students to learn operating system concepts by implementing core components themselves.

### Current Features

- ✅ **Multiboot-compliant bootloader** - Boots via GRUB/QEMU
- ✅ **Serial I/O driver** (COM1) - Communication via serial port
- ✅ **Null process** - Single process that reads and echoes input
- ✅ **Basic string utilities** - Essential string operations
- ✅ **Clean, documented code** - Easy to understand and extend

### Future Extensions (Student Assignments)

Students will extend kacchiOS by implementing:
- 📝 **Memory Manager**
- 📝 **Process Manager**
- 📝 **Scheduler**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential qemu-system-x86 gcc-multilib

# On Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel qemu gcc-multilib

# On macOS
brew install qemu i686-elf-gcc
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kacchiOS.git
cd kacchiOS

# Build the OS
make clean
make

# Run in QEMU
make run
```

You should see:
```

    kacchiOS - Minimal Baremetal OS
========================================
Hello from kacchiOS!
Running null process...

kacchiOS> 
```

Type something and press Enter - it will echo back!
